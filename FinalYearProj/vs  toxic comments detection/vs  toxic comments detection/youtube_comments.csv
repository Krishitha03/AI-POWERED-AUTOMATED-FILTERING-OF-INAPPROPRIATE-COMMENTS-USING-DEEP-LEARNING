@richardburakov1998,2023-10-24T18:41:18Z,1,"This september I was travelling around Europe and met up with my best friend in Paris. We went for a day trip to Giverny to check out Claude Monet's home. I brought some magic mushrooms with me from Netherlands where I just came from, so we had a nice little trip among the gardens that Monet painted in his work. It was a magical experience. Then we got back to Paris and went for a dinner to one of my favorite restaurants, smoking a joint right before it to enjoy the meal even more. That restaurant, called Tiger Tiger (widely recommended), is literally around the corner from where this episode was filmed - it's an area near Canal St. Martin and it's my favorite part of Paris - not at all touristic, full of gastronomic pleasure and a nice place to chill - whenever I go there, I feel like I live in Paris and not visit it as a tourist. After the dinner, we went to a Lebanese ice cream shop to eat booza, and to top it all off, we went for a nice little stroll down the Seine.
